## Introduction

**LSPosed ET** is a maintained fork of [LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed) by the **EzequielDevTeam Technology**, focused on keeping the framework fully functional on the newest Android releases — including **Android 16 (API 36)**, which the upstream project no longer officially supports.

LSPosed itself is an evolution of the classic [Xposed Framework](https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed) by rovo89: a module system that allows small apps ("modules") to alter the behavior of the operating system and of other applications **without modifying any APK file**. Instead of decompiling and repacking apps, modules inject logic into running processes through method hooking at the ART virtual machine level.

Where the original Xposed required installing a modified `app_process` directly into `/system` (breaking OTA updates and requiring full system modification), LSPosed achieves the same result entirely from userspace through [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk)'s systemless infrastructure, using either the **Zygisk** or **Riru** injection mechanism.

---

## How it works

The boot sequence performs the following steps, typically within the first seconds after power-on:

1. **Magisk** starts and injects its Zygisk companion library (`libzygisk.so`) into **Zygote**, the parent process from which every Android application is forked.
2. Zygisk loads the **`zygisk_lsposed`** module into the Zygote address space.
3. The module spawns the **daemon (`lspd`)**, which runs as the `system` user with elevated privileges and stays alive for the entire uptime.
4. The daemon applies its own **SELinux policy rules** (`sepolicy.rule`) so that regular applications are allowed to communicate with it over Binder IPC.
5. From this point on, **every newly forked application process inherits the injected runtime**: when a module declares scope over an app, that specific process gets the module's code loaded before the application's own classes run.

Hooking itself is delegated to **[LSPlant](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPlant)**, an ART-native engine that rewrites method entry points at runtime (trampoline-based inline hooking backed by a JIT-aware code cache strategy). When a module registers a callback on, say, `WindowManager.LayoutParams.flags`, every call made by the hooked process executes the module's Java code first — effectively "replacing circuit boards while the machine keeps running".

### Components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `zygisk_lsposed` / `riru_lsposed` | Magisk module: entry point injected during boot, hands off control to the daemon |
| Daemon (`lspd`) | The brain: manages installed modules, scopes, per-app resource redirection, applies hooks, publishes the manager binder service |
| `manager.apk` | User interface: lists modules, toggles them, configures scopes, shows framework status and logs |
| Vendored libxposed **API 100** | Stable ABI consumed by modules, compiled against `io.github.libxposed:api:100` |

---

## Features

- **Systemless**: nothing outside the Magisk module directory is modified
- **Per-app scoping**: modules only run inside processes they explicitly target — zero overhead everywhere else
- **Modern API surface**: implements the next-generation [libxposed API](https://github.com/libxposed/api) alongside legacy compatibility paths
- **Resource hooks**: modules can replace strings, layouts and drawables of target apps
- **Detection resistance**: integrates with the Magisk denylist so hooked apps cannot trivially observe the framework
- **Self-updating**: the module ships an `update.json` consumed by the Magisk app for seamless upgrades

## Supported versions

| Android version | Status |
|-----------------|--------|
| 8.1 – 13 (API 27 – 34) | ✅ Supported |
| 14 – 15 (API 34 – 35) | ✅ Supported |
| **16 (API 36)** | ✅ **Fully supported** (upgraded LSPlant v6.4 + `IUserManager.getUsers` fix for API 36) |
| 17 (future) | ⏳ Planned — support will land once devices and custom ROMs have fully transitioned |

---

## Installation

1. Ensure **Magisk 24.0+** is installed with **Zygisk enabled**
2. Flash the appropriate zip from the [Releases](https://github.com/EzequielDevTeam/LSPosed-ET/releases) page:
   - `LSPosed-*-zygisk-release.zip` for Magisk with Zygisk (recommended)
   - `LSPosed-*-riru-release.zip` for setups still using Riru
3. Reboot
4. Install the bundled `manager.apk` (manually or through the notification shortcut)
5. Install modules, enable them, assign scopes, force-stop target apps

## Differences from upstream

| Area | This fork |
|------|-----------|
| Android 16 | Works out of the box (LSPlant v6.4, daemon fixes) |
| Identity | `LSPosed ET` / EzequielDevTeam Technology |
| Updater | Points to this repository's `update.json` |
| CI | Self-hosted GitHub Actions pipeline producing signed artifacts |
| libxposed API | Vendored `api:100` artifacts built reproducibly inside CI |
